Hi all, I'm Ziwei XU (in Chinese: 许子微). Welcome to Ziwei's space.  

I am interested on computer science and got my PhD degree from University de Nantes (France) in June 2021. From 2022, i am working as a researcher at AIST (in Japanese: 産業技術総合研究所) in Japan.

This website is used to update my academic progresses.
