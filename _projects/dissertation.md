### Abstract ###
<blockquote>
<p>
This dissertation aims to enhance LDA’s utilities of conceptualizing terms towards ontology learning, where similar terms are clustered to the predefined core concepts. We explored the classic workflow of term clustering and studied the clustering impacts of the terms representation techniques. Comparatively, we proposed the LDA based clustering strategy, where the prior knowledge embedding techniques are applied to semisupervise the LDA for the more satisfying clusters. In addition, we built up the taxonomic structure of the ontology, by internally applying the subcategorization frames over noun phrases and externally benefitting from the knowledge bases. The experiment results showed that our proposed LDA based clustering strategy outperformed the majority of the clustering works in the classic workflow. Our optimal prior knowledge embedding approach exceeded the performance of basic LDA and Seeded LDA but dropped behind the Z-label LDA. This dissertation suggests that the LDA based clustering strategy could contribute to the anticipating term conceptualizations for ontology learning.
